**# Kickstarting with Excel**

**##Overview of Project**

######This study aims to determine factors of a successful fundraising campaign to help Louise plan and organize her first crowdfunding campaign to reach $10,000 goal for her first play "Fever".

**##Analysis and Challenges**

**###Analysis of Outcome Based on Launch Date**

######A new column was created and was labeled "Years", then data for this column were extracted from  Column S "Data Created Conversion" using the Year Function Year (). Pivot table was created to extract and summarize data by using Kickstarter Worksheet. "Parent Category" and "Years" were assigned as the filters, "Data Created Conversion" selected as input for the rows and "outcome" for columns and values. On the pivot table "Parent Category" was filtered to show only "theater" data. Rows were grouped to show only months. Finally "outcome" was sorted descending to show successful outcome first.

**###Analysis of Outcome Based on Goals**

######Countifs function was used to show the trend and relationship between the goal value and its outcome of the subcategory "play".

**###Challenges and Difficulties Encountered**

######Assigning the right set of data and what data to extract from the main worksheet to create the pivot table. Performing the correct countifs formula to show the relationship and trend of data in a graph. 

**##Results##

######Outcome Based on Launch Date shows that 111 out of 164 campaign events were successful when launch in the month of May. While Failed outcomes occured mostly in the month of May to August with 50 failed events. Outcome Based on Goal shows that goals less that $1000 is most achievable with 76% success followed by $1000 to $4999 goals with 73% success rate. On the other hand, goals of $45000 and more is somewhat hard to attained. 

**###Conclusion for Outcome Based on Launch Date**

######Theater crowdfunding campaign is most successful when launch in the month of May and June but least successful at the beginning and end of the year. Canceled events are very minimal.

**###Conclusion for Outcome Based on Goal**

######Having a goal $5,000 and less is attainable and reflects more success. And having a campaign goal of 45,000 or more is the least achievable for a crowdfunding campaign like plays.

**##Limitations**

######Analyzing data that involves crowd/people, I think there should be data that reflects demographics. Demographics is very useful in identifying the target audience in order to come up with the most effective marketing approach to promote crowdfunding campaigns.

**###Possible Table and Graphs to Create**

######Tables and graphs that sort and visualize patterns and trends between "outcomes", "goals" and "pledged".
